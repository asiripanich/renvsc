The goal of renvsc is to enable using the renv package in VSCode without breaking the nice features of the vscode-R extension.

`renvsc::init()` adds some extra steps to `renv::init()` to maintain vscode-R's sessionWatcher and 'R: Launch RStudio Addin' features after an [renv] environment gets activated. 

- Step 1: Create `dependencies.R` at the path that is determined by `getwd()`, if not specifically provided, and add `library(languageserver); library(jsonlite); library(rlang)` to the file.
- Step2: Add `library(rstudioapi)` to `dependencies.R`, and then add `options(vsc.rstudioapi = TRUE)` to `.Rprofile` created by `renv::init()`.
